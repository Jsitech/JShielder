#  This is the configuration file for psad (the Port Scan Attack Detector).
#  Normally this file gets installed at /etc/psad/psad.conf, but can be put
#  anywhere in the filesystem and then the path can be specified on the
#  command line argument "-c <file>" to psad.  All three psad daemons (psad,
#  kmsgsd, and psadwatchd) reference this config file.  Note that kmsgsd is
#  generally deprecated since by default psad parses iptables log messages
#  directly from the file where syslog writes them.  Further, psadwatchd is
#  not required if running on a Linux system that already has a process
#  monitoring and restarting capability built-in such as provided by the
#  upstart daemon.
#
#  Each line has the form  "<variable name>    <value>;".  Note the semi-
#  colon after the <value>.  All characters after the semicolon will be
#  ignored to provide space for comments.

### Supports multiple email addresses (as a comma separated
### list).
EMAIL_ADDRESSES             INBOX;

### Machine hostname
HOSTNAME                    CHANGEME;

### Specify the home and external networks.  Note that by default the
### ENABLE_INTF_LOCAL_NETS is enabled, so psad automatically detects
### all of the directly connected subnets and uses this information as
### the HOME_NET variable.
HOME_NET                    any;
EXTERNAL_NET                any;

### The FW_SEARCH_ALL variable controls how psad will parse iptables
### messages.  If it is set to "Y" then psad will parse all iptables
### messages for evidence of scan activity.  If it is set to "N" then
### psad will only parse those iptables messages that contain logging
### prefixes specified by the FW_MSG_SEARCH variable below.  Logging
### prefixes are set with the --log-prefix command line option to iptables.
### Setting FW_SEARCH_ALL to "N" is useful for having psad only analyze
### iptables messages that are logged out of a specific iptables chain
### (multiple strings can be searched for, see the comment above the
### FW_MSG_SEARCH variable below) or a specific logging rule for example.
### FW_SEARCH_ALL is set to "Y" by default since usually people want psad
### to parse all iptables messages.
FW_SEARCH_ALL               Y;

### The FW_MSG_SEARCH variable can be modified to look for logging messages
### that are specific to your firewall configuration (specified by the
### "--log-prefix" option.  For example, if your firewall uses the
### string "Audit" for packets that have been blocked, then you could
### set FW_MSG_SEARCH to "Audit";  The default string to search for is
### "DROP".  Both psad and kmsgsd reference this file.  NOTE: You can
### specify this variable multiple times to have psad search for multiple
### strings.  For example to have psad search for the strings "Audit" and
### "Reject", you would use the following two lines:
#FW_MSG_SEARCH               Audit;
#FW_MSG_SEARCH               REJECT;
FW_MSG_SEARCH               DROP;

### Set the type of syslog daemon that is used.  The SYSLOG_DAEMON
### variable accepts four possible values: syslogd, syslog-ng, ulogd,
### or metalog.  Note: this variable is only used if ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE is
### disabled, and this in turn will mean that the legacy kmsgsd daemon will
### collect firewall logs from syslog via the old named pipe mechanism.
SYSLOG_DAEMON               syslogd;

### What type of interface configuration do you use?  Set this variable to
### "iproute2" if you want to use the iproute2 type configuration.
### iproute2 does not use aliases for multi-homed interfaces and
### ifconfig does not show secondary addresses for multi-homed interfaces.
#IFCFGTYPE  iproute2;
IFCFGTYPE                   ifconfig;

### Danger levels.  These represent the total number of
### packets required for a scan to reach each danger level.
### A scan may also reach a danger level if the scan trips
### a signature or if the scanning ip is listed in
### auto_ips so a danger level is automatically
### assigned.
DANGER_LEVEL1               5;    ### Number of packets.
DANGER_LEVEL2               15;

DANGER_LEVEL4               1500;
DANGER_LEVEL5               10000;

### Set the interval (in seconds) psad will use to sleep before
### checking for new iptables log messages
CHECK_INTERVAL              5;

### Search for snort "sid" values generated by fwsnort
### or snort2iptables
SNORT_SID_STR               SID;

### For systems with an init daemon like 'upstart' that offer built-in process
### monitoring, it is not necessary to run the psadwatchd daemon.  For such
### systems, the following variable can be set to 'N' to disable psadwatched
### altogether.
ENABLE_PSADWATCHD           N;

### Set the minimum range of ports that must be scanned before
### psad will send an alert.  The default is 1 so that at
### least two port must be scanned (p2-p1 >= 1).  This can be set
### to 0 if you want psad to be extra paranoid, or 30000 if not.
PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD   1;

### For IP protocol scan detection (nmap -sO).  While it may be relatively
### common for a host to trigger on tcp, udp, and icmp, it is more unusual if
### a host triggers on, say, five different IP protocols
PROTOCOL_SCAN_THRESHOLD     5;

### If "Y", means that scans will never timeout.  This is useful
### for catching scans that take place over long periods of time
### where the attacker is trying to slip beneath the IDS thresholds.

### This is used only if ENABLE_PERSISTENCE = "N";
SCAN_TIMEOUT                3600;  ### seconds

### Specify how often to timeout old scan data relative to CHECK_INTERVAL
### iterations.  This feature is only used if ENABLE_PERSISTENCE is disabled.
### Note that for psad processes that have tracked a lot of scans, it is
### advisable to leave this threshold at the default value of 5 or greater
### because the scan tracking hash may be quite large.
PERSISTENCE_CTR_THRESHOLD   5;

### Limit the number of src->dst IP pairs that psad will track.  The default
### is zero (i.e. unlimited), but if psad is running on a system with limited
### memory, this can be handy to restrict psad's memory usage.  It is best to
### combine this option with disabling ENABLE_PERSISTENCE so that older scans
### are deleted and therefore newer scans will on average continue to be
### tracked.  A good non-zero value is, say, 50000, but this will vary
### depending on available system memory.
MAX_SCAN_IP_PAIRS           0;

### If "Y", means all signatures will be shown since
### the scan started instead of just the current ones.
SHOW_ALL_SIGNATURES         N;

### Allow reporting methods to be enabled/restricted.  This keyword can
### accept values of "nosyslog" (don't write any messages to syslog),
### "noemail" (don't send any email messages), or "ALL" (to generate both
### syslog and email messages).  "ALL" is the default.  Both "nosyslog"
### and "noemail" can be combined with a comma to disable all logging
### and alerting.
ALERTING_METHODS            ALL;

### By default, psad checks for journalctl on systems where systemd is
### installed. If journalctl is running, then psad will automatically acquire
### syslog data from journalctl instead of parsing a file in the /var/log/
### directory.
AUTO_DETECT_JOURNALCTL      Y;

### The following vars have psad acquire iptables log data from the
### /var/log/messages file which the local syslog daemon (usually) writes
### iptables log messages to.  If the ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE variable below is set
### to "N", then psad reconfigures syslog to write iptables log data to the
### /var/lib/psad/psadfifo fifo file where the messages are picked up by kmsgsd
### written to the file /var/log/psad/fwdata for analysis by psad.  On some
### systems, having syslog communicate log data to kmsgsd can be problematic
### (syslog configs and external factors such as Apparmor and SELinux can play
### a role here), so leaving the ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE variable set to "Y" is
### usually recommended. However, if psad is running on a system where systemd
### is installed and syslog messages are accessed via journalctl instead of
### being written to the filesystem, then the ENABLE_FW_MSG_READ_CMD

### includes the OPT field before expecting the remaining messages to also

EXPECT_TCP_OPTIONS          Y;

### Minimum danger level a scan must reach before any logging or

### "From_chain": Is the chain from which packets will be jumped.
